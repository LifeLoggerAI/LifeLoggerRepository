NOTE: The release checklist file to update is located at ./RELEASE-PLAYBOOK.md in the current repo. Please load and update it in real time as we go through the launch process.

You are working in my UrAi project repo.

Goal:
Guide me through the UrAi release process using `/RELEASE-PLAYBOOK.md`, covering only:
- Day‑1 Post‑Launch Monitoring

Instructions for Codex:
1. Load `/RELEASE-PLAYBOOK.md`.
2. For each checklist item in this scope:
   - Ask me to verify the step.
   - Wait for my input:
     ✅ = Pass
     ❌ = Fail
   - If ❌, ask me for a short issue note.
   - Update the file:
     * Change `[ ]` to `[✅]` for passes.
     * Change `[ ]` to `[❌]` for fails and append `(Issue: <note>)`.
   - Save immediately.
3. After all items:
   - Count total passes & fails.
   - Append a **Day‑1 Monitoring Log** with:
     - Date & time
     - Pass count
     - Fail count
     - Failed items with notes
     - Final Go/No‑Go decision
