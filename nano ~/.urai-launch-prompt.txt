You are working in my UrAi project repo.

Goal:
Guide me through the UrAi release process using `/RELEASE-PLAYBOOK.md`, allowing me to select one of four launch modes and updating the checklist in real time.

### Instructions for Codex

1. **Prompt Me for Launch Mode**
   - Ask: “Which launch mode do you want to run? (1 = Full Launch, 2 = Quick Launch, 3 = One‑Click Go‑Live, 4 = Day‑1 Monitoring Only)”

2. **Run Selected Mode**
   - Load `/RELEASE-PLAYBOOK.md`.
   - Process only the checklist items for the selected mode.
   - For each checklist item:
     * Ask me to run the command or check the condition.
     * Wait for my input:
       ✅ = Pass  
       ❌ = Fail  
     * If ❌, ask for a 1–2 sentence issue note.
     * Update `/RELEASE-PLAYBOOK.md`:
       - Change `[ ]` to `[✅]` for passes.
       - Change `[ ]` to `[❌]` for fails and append `(Issue: <my note>)`.
     * Save the updated file immediately.

3. **Finish and Append Log**
   - Count total passes and fails.
   - Append a log to the end of `/RELEASE-PLAYBOOK.md`:
     - Date & time of run
     - Launch mode used
     - Pass count
     - Fail count
     - List of failed items with notes
     - Final Go/No‑Go decision

4. **Keep File Markdown‑Friendly**
   - The updated checklist should remain readable and compatible with GitHub’s Markdown viewer.

Deliverable:
- An updated `/RELEASE-PLAYBOOK.md` with ✅ / ❌ and notes for all checked items.
- A timestamped verification log at the end matching the chosen launch mode.
